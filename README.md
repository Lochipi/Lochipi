## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cornelius Emase, a software engineer intern at Radical X with a keen interest in data-related careers also.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on developing and testing software applications at Radical X, where I've gained valuable experience in [insert programming languages, frameworks, or tools you've worked with]. I'm also interested in exploring data science, machine learning, and data engineering.

ðŸŒ± I'm constantly learning and growing my skills in software development, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open source projects, and attending tech meetups.

ðŸ’¬ If you'd like to chat or collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me corneliuslochipi@gmail.com.

- âš¡ I love watching planes flying ðŸ¤©
